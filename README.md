# 724Technology Repository

Welcome to the `724Technology` repository! This repository contains customized web files and assets for various clients. Each client has their own folder with files that define their unique design and style, including background images, CSS styles, and an `index.html` file for web page content.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

```
724technology/
├── wise/
│   ├── wise-background.jpg
│   ├── index.html
│   └── wise-styler.css
├── example-customer/
│   ├── customer-background.jpg
│   ├── index.html
│   └── customer-styler.css
└── README.md
```

### Folder Details

Each client folder (e.g., `wise`) contains:
- **Background Image**: A customized background image file (e.g., `wise-background.jpg`).
- **HTML File**: An `index.html` file tailored to the client’s requirements, containing the HTML structure and references to background images and styles.
- **CSS File**: A CSS file (e.g., `wise-styler.css`) that defines specific styles such as colors, fonts, and layout settings.

## How to Add a New Client

1. **Create a Folder**: Add a new folder under the root directory with the client’s name.
2. **Add Assets**: Include the following in the client’s folder:
   - **Background Image**: A `.jpg` or `.png` file with the client-specific background image.
   - **HTML File**: An `index.html` file referencing the background image and CSS styles.
   - **CSS File**: A custom `.css` file for additional styling.
3. **Link Files**: Ensure that the `index.html` file correctly links to the background image and CSS file.

## Usage

Open the client’s `index.html` file in a browser to view the customized web page, which includes the background image and styles defined in the CSS file.
